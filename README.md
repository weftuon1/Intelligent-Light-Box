## Introduction
**iLight Display Window —— Light up your life!**

This project is aiming to produce a display window that can control led light automatically. No matter how does environment light shed around our object, it can perfectly show the beauty of exhibit.

### Function
- **Detecting lightness of display window**
- **Adjusting the luminance of LED and the position to light on**
- **Monitoring exhibit via camera**

### System Architecture
![system architecture][0]

## Hardware and Software Setup

### Required Hardware
- 1 ARC IoT Development Kit
- 1 Base Shiled V2
- 2 Servo Motor
- 1 Ligt Sensor
- 1 Webcam
- 1 Raspberry Pi 3
- 1 Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi
- 8 White LED
- 1 Wireless Dual-Band Mini USB Adapter(EW-7811UTC)

### Required Software
- Metaware or ARC GNU Toolset
- Serial port terminal, such as putty, MobaXterm or CuteCom

### Hardware Connection
1. ARC IoTDK
   - Connect to PC via USB port.
   - Connect to RPi via uart port(pin IO0, IO1, GND).
   - Connect to two servos via pin IO2, IO4, GND, VCC.
   - Connect to LED vio pin IO3, GND.
   - Connect to light sensor via pin AD0, GND, VCC.

## User Manual

### Before Running This Application
- Environment: In door with proper lightness
- On RPi: Install opencv, fswebcam, pyserial. Check ls /dev/video? before using fswebcam command.
- On ARC IoTDK: Set parameters for location to degree transformation.
- Connect Everything as mentioned above.

### Run This Application
- First, download the folder ./src/iLight_arc_node. Put it into the folder of /embarc_ops/example/baremetal, then command "make run".
- After that, download the file ./RPi/find_the_darkest-area.py on RPi and run it. 
- Camera will start to work and you're all set.
